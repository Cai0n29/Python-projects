Back when I was only five years old, pizza was always one of my favorite food in my life.

From pizza parties with my classmates or to me at home alone ordering dominos all for myself.

The most exciting part about ordering pizza is when it comes knocking on your door at the middle of the night in a cardboard box, waiting to be opened and when you open it, there’s eights beautiful yummy slices waiting for you in there to be demolished.

As I grew up, I started to notice that everybody devours there pizza differently.

There are some people like me who just eat it normally, then there’s those who fold their pizza.

The ones I find the most annoying ones who eat their pizza are the ones who cut their pizza with a knife. I don’t know why I find it …show more content…

I always eat pizza on special occasions like when It’s my birthday or when it’s my friend’s birthday or when I am hungry.

Why I say dominos is my favorite then the rest of the other pizza places is because dominos makes its pizza a hand tossed pizza with a Garlic-seasoned crust with a rich, buttery taste to it with every bite.

Like the crust feels perfect in your hand when you are holding it.

There are other options for the pizza crust like the handmade pan, it’s a Two layer of cheese, toppings to the edge, baked in a pan for a crust that is golden and crispy with a buttery taste to it and there’s the Brooklyn style it’s a hand stretched to be big, thin and perfectly foldable. 

The one I hate the most from all the other crusts is the crunchy thin crust. The reason I hate it because the pizza is so fragile and skinny and like there no crust in it.
